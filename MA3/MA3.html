          I graduated from Fort Dorchester High School in Charleston, SC in 2017
          with the idea that I would go on to study engineering at USF and
          design rollercoasters for popular amusement parks like Disney. The
          truth was that I always wanted to study theatre and go on to be an
          actor. I have a huge passion for performance art and I was heavily
          involved in it during high school, singing in chorus and being in
          musicals. I'm too nervous to spend money on thousands of dollars on a
          theatre degree, though, so I decided to major in engineering and minor
          in theatre.

        <h3>HCC, USF, and Changing Majors</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <p>
          I was supposed to start at USF during the summer of 2017, but I
          couldn't afford to start at that time and they told me that I could
          take some credits at a community college and return to USF the next
          the year. So begins my college journey at HCC in Tampa, living with my
          older sister. It was uneventful, taking general courses and a little
          lackluster. The most fun I had was in an acting class that I took on
          the downtown campus in spring. But in summer of 2018, I started at USF
          and it was average. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't until fall, that
          things started falling apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was going through huge financial issues. The Financial Aid Office
          was absolutely horrible and unhelpful. They, somehow, never received
          my FAFSA and so labelled me as a student, forcing me to take out a
          private loan. There was a lot of lies, miscommunication, and outright
          hostile attitudes from the office. I eventually got it sorted it out,
          but it was too late as the toll of the entire situation dragged out
          through the semester and caused my grades to suffer, especially in
          Physics which I outright failed. I decided to leave USF due to
          mistreatment from the staff and return to HCC. I tried to retake
          Physics which I only barely passed with a D and that was when I
          realized that maybe engineering wasn't for me.

        <h3>UCF and Web Design</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <p>
          I finished my AA in Arts at HCC and then my sister decided to move to
          Orlando and gave me the choice of staying to go to USF or apply to new
          college in Orlando. I considered applying to Full Sail for animation
          as cartoons and anime are big staples in my life, but I never animated
          anything and didn't have the portfolio or the money to go to such a
          school. So, I applied to UCF for Digital Media, Web Design and Social
          Platforms. I kind of liked it at first. It was okay, if a little
          boring. I liked the creative aspect of making a webpage look nice and
          having that creative liberty, but it was nothing like being on stage
          or holding a paint brush or sketch pencil. This semester, however,
          made me realize how much I genuinely hate coding. Maybe it's the
          pandemic, affecting how the classes were taught, but I dreaded
          attending Zoom calls and doing assignments. And, towards the end of
          the semester, I stopped showing up and skipped a few assignments.

        <h3>My Future at UCF</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <p>
          I realized that coding and web design isn't something that I want to
          do for the rest of my life. I feel bored, tired, and just plain
          frustrated doing this and asking for help and receiving very little...
          Working in entertainment is what I've always wanted to do whether it
          be working behind the scenes or being in front of the audience, so I
          changed my major again to Radio and Television Communication with a
          minor in Theatre-Acting. I'm honestly very excited for a future in
          mass communication and getting back into acting, especially voice
          acting because it would allow me to work a little closer to animation.
          It took a while for me to realize what I wanted to do and there's been
          a lot of anxiety along the way, but I'm happy with my decisions so
          far.
